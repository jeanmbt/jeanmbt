Change embracer, Challenge seeker, Expectation breaker. 

I moved to Germany in September 2017, coming from Brazil.
I discovered myself as a Web Developer after years working as a Beauty-Artist in the Fashion and Advertising branch and Creative Director for Art Projects. My former experiences prepared me for the challenges I face daily when developing Web applications, there's no challenge big enough for me. The intrinsic necessity to create, build and share motivates me to discover new things every day. I am dedicated, adaptable, social, creative and proactive. I think out of the box and I come up with clever solutions for problems I face and I'm eager to learn and develop therefore I'm constantly challenging myself. I like to put extra energy to deliver the best possible and go the extra mile to exceed expectations.
Part of my daily routine is to practice exertion and to research different topics to aggregate knowledge and improve my skills set.
I am sociable and I find it enriching knowing more about people I'm around and their experiences.
